When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	When working with multiple contributers or from multiple systems. Also as a backup

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	You only want changes to be in your local if you are ready for it meaning you functional block is working/finished
